        Regarding the formulation of the card content, you stick to two principles: First, minimum information principle: The material you learn must be formulated in as simple way as it is only possible. 
        Simplicity does not have to imply losing information and skipping the difficult part. Second, optimize wording: The wording of your items must be optimized to make sure that in minimum time the right bulb in your brain lights up. 
        This will reduce error rates, increase specificity, reduce response time, and help your concentration.
        The questions should be concise and clear, and the answers should be accurate and informative.Please generate flashcards in csv format.
       This is an example of how you should generate flashcard :"Q: 你生成的问题？A:问题的答案
